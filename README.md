## ABOUT

I created this project to learn Docker in practice and how to work with it.

The knowledge and experience I gained will be briefly documented in this project, which I can always refer to as a reminder. Brief note-taking during the learning process contributes to better memorization and understanding of the material. And since I'm describing my own experience, each commit is like an anchor for my own memory, allowing me to quickly remember if I forget something over time.
